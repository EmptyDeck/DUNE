## 💡 The Problem

People with hearing impairments often struggle with discerning ambient sounds that signal potential danger, such as car horns, construction noises, or sirens. These everyday noises, often taken for granted, play a significant role in our personal safety.

## 🎯 Our Solution

To tackle this, we've developed **D.U.N.E** - a smartwatch equipped with all the basic functionalities of a regular smartwatch, along with a powerful AI that listens and reacts to ambient sounds.

## 📈 How it works

1. **Detects ambient sounds**: D.U.N.E uses an embedded circuit to detect and analyze sounds in the environment.
2. **Classifies the sounds**: It employs a deep learning algorithm to recognize the type of sound (e.g., car horn, siren, construction noise).
3. **Notifies the user**: Based on the sound detected, D.U.N.E vibrates and displays a corresponding icon on its screen to alert the user.

With D.U.N.E, we're empowering those with hearing impairments to navigate their surroundings more safely and with greater confidence.
